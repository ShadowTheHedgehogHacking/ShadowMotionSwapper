Simple program to accelerate making "Custom BON" type Character Mods from swapping

## Dependencies:
* Requires [.NET 8 Desktop Runtime](https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-applaunch?missing_runtime=true&arch=x64&apphost_version=8.0.0&gui=true)

## Features:
* Ability to keep original properties of a MTN or replace props with the replacement MTN. This can be toggled per MTN.
* No files are modified until Export is pressed- This acts as "Save As".
* Replace a MTP's MTN entry with a .MTN not packed within another MTP ("Replace..." button) 
* Log window to easily save history of edits for later

## Credits:
* dreamsyntax for main program, fixing ShadowMTPSharp to produce 1:1 game readable MTPs
* Sewer56 for initial work on ShadowMTPSharp & ShadowMTP
* Uses modified version of DarkTheme by [Otiel](https://github.com/Otiel)
